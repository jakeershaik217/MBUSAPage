More than letting all four tires do the work equally, 4MATIC features a number of advanced, and quick-thinking innovations to empower each wheel individually as conditions change. So whether you're starting out on a slippery patch, encountering a sudden change in the weather, or even rounding a dry curve, 4MATIC helps you put your best foot forward.</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo">  Image Exists As Expected :: File Name :: https://assets.mbusa.com/vcm/MB/DigitalAssets/4MATIC/2017-GLS-THEME-PAGE.jpg</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo"> Pass </td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo">      Link ::  Pass   </td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Discover more about 4MATIC all-wheel drive</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Available for</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Greater control, gripping results</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">22</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Each wheel fully engaged.

It's fully integrated not just with the drivetrain but the many safety and driving assistance systems of a Mercedes-Benz. Under normal conditions, the compact, lightweight system channels the engine's torque to the front and rear wheels through a center differential, for sporty balance and agile handling. When traction demands change, 4MATIC reacts instantly and expertly to maximize control. By sending power to the wheels that can use it best, it helps you feel a rewarding sense of confidence in any season.
