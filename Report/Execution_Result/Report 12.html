You push the button and the door goes up and down. But, behind the scenes the technology has evolved into some rather high tech devices driven by the need for higher security for the homeowner.There are two types of garage door openers:1. DIP Switch Programmable2. Rolling CodeWhich Type Do You Have?Determine which type of garage door opener you have by opening the battery compartment on one of the handheld transmitters you use to operate your garage door.1. If you see a row of tiny sliding levers inside your handheld transmitter, your opener uses a single code to operate every time and is a "DIP Switch" programmable type transmitter. There is a lack of security when using these old technology transmitters because someone either could choose the same code as your opener, or a thief using a code grabber (a radio receiver which steals your code) could then open your door.2. If there are no switches, the opener is a Rolling Code type transmitter. This type of transmitter enhances security by using a new code each time the transmitter is operated, since codes which where previously used to operate the door are no longer recognized as valid. Use of this Rolling Codes started in 1996, and by 2000 most manufacturers had switched to this technology.Programming Homelink ButtonWarning! Before starting to program, ensure no one is standing under or near the garage door, as it may operate while programming the mirror!Using the instructions in your vehicle's Operator's Manual, you must program a button in the vehicle by holding a working handheld transmitter near the garage-door buttons while pressing the button in the vehicle. These buttons are located either in your vehicle's inside rearview mirror or overhead console (see your Operator's Manual for complete details). It is recommended that you put new batteries in the handheld transmitter before attempting to program your vehicle, so the transmitter is able to transmit at the proper frequency or proper code.For transmitters that control multiple garage doors and have multiple buttons, treat each button on the remote as if it was a separate transmitter.Verification That The Homelink Button Was ProgrammedVerification of whether the button in the vehicle is programmed is accomplished by pressing it. It should flash rapidly and then turn solid after 2 seconds.Programming Homelink to the Opener1. For DIP Switch Programmable transmitters no other action is necessary. The door should operate from either the mirror or the hand held transmitter.2. For Rolling Code Transmitters it may be necessary to program the Homelink button into your opener before it will operate the door.Then, using the instructions which came with your garage door opener, program the Homelink button into the garage door opener. Most opener's receivers will operate as follows. (Some may require a different procedure.) Locate its "training," "learn" or "smart" button, and press it. Within 30 seconds, return to your vehicle and press the desired Homelink button in your vehicle for 2 seconds, then release it for 2 seconds, and then repeat this up to three times, until the button is trained and your garage door operates.Mercedes-Benz recommends that the handheld Rolling Code transmitter should be saved for when a new vehicle is purchased and needs to be programmed, and not used at the same time as the one in your mirror. This is because the button in the mirror has cloned the button from the original handheld remote, and is using the rolling code taken from it. This may in some cases cause the transmitter in the mirror to stop operating the opener, as the handheld or another vehicle transmitter may have already used the rolling code in your vehicle. Most openers can learn and simultaneously be linked to five or more remotes.</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> How can I obtain a vehicle brochure?</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Brochures can be downloaded directly from the Class and Model pages on MBUSA.com, using the "Download Brochure" link.

Using Mercedes-Benz service products will protect you from expensive repair costs resulting from use of inferior products.Approved Service Products are also designed to protect your engine and transmission from contaminants, particulates and sludge build-up. Non-approved products could potentially cause long-term durability and dependability issues including damage to seals, surfaces, coatings and mechanical components. They may also create emission-related problems and lead to oil sludge build up. The use of aftermarket flushing procedures is not recommended since they can force contaminants past valves and seals, creating subsequent performance issues and component damage that may not appear until many miles or months later. Further, if non-approved maintenance products or procedures have been used, a major engine, transmission or driveline repair may not be covered by your Mercedes-Benz warranty.

This is to promote water drainage. If the steering wheel is released or the driver does not steer the vehicle on its intended path, it may drift or 'pull' to one side. Just as it is natural for a car to roll down a hill, there is an equally natural tendency for a car to drift toward the side on a laterally sloped roadway. While curved roads are often 'banked' toward the inside of a curve to promote safer cornering, straight roadways that slant to one side can require some force on the steering wheel - in the opposite direction - to maintain a straight-ahead path. Such behavior on a sloping road is not indicative of any misalignment of the wheels, especially if your vehicle tracks straight on a level road.</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Why does the brake pedal in my hybrid Mercedes-Benz feel different the first time I step on the brakes after I start the vehicle and sometimes during normal driving?</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Hybrid vehicles utilize regenerative and conventional hydraulic braking to reduce the speed of the vehicle. For regenerative braking, the kinetic energy of the decelerating vehicle is absorbed by the electric motor to generate a brake torque. The generated electrical energy is then fed to the high voltage battery for storage. Conventional hydraulic brakes utilize hydraulic fluid to apply pressure to the brake pads which squeeze against a rotating brake rotor. Friction is created between the pads and rotor which generate a brake torque to stop the vehicle.Depending on the driving conditions, the total braking torque requested by the driver can be divided into a regenerative component and a hydraulic component. If the required total braking torque can be achieved using regenerative means alone, then none of the braking is done hydraulically. In this case deceleration is achieved solely by using the electric motors to generate electricity.Due to the operating principals involved, the perceived brake pedal feel may be different during regenerative braking compared to conventional braking. On the regenerative braking system, there is a length of free travel integrated into the connection of the brake pedal. This is used during the regenerative braking function. A pedal force simulator is used to create an artificial pedal resistance which mimics the brake pedal feel of conventional hydraulic brakes.During the first brake actuation, the system is checked for proper operation and the regenerative braking system is activated. The pedal force simulator is switched off for the first pedal application, resulting in slightly longer pedal travel compared to subsequent brake pedal applications when the system is active.If an ABS (Anti-Lock Brake System) intervention takes place, regenerative braking is terminated for this brake application and the braking torque is provided solely via the conventional hydraulic brakes.Regenerative braking is not possible below speeds of approximately 13 MPH. As soon as the vehicle drops below a speed of approximately 13 MPH during a brake application, the system switches from regenerative braking to hydraulic braking, resulting in a change of brake pedal feel and travel.</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Maintenance</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> I have my car washed regularly and yet the wheels have stains which cannot be removed.

Many car washes use acid-based cleaners to remove brake dust and road grime very quickly in order to maximize the throughput of vehicles in the wash lane. Acid-based chemicals can also be found in high-strength cleaning products. These products can leach through the clearcoat and leave visible dark streaks or runs on the wheel which cannot be washed off. These products can also remove the corrosion protection applied by the factory to the wheel lugs, brake hardware and other components visible near the wheels. When this happens, these items can begin to corrode. Components that are damaged by non-approved cleaning solutions are not covered under the Mercedes-Benz warranty. Only approved Mercedes-Benz paint care products and cleaners must be used. Contact your Mercedes-Benz Dealer for approved car care and wheel cleaning products.

Scratch Resistant Clearcoat (SRC) uses "nano-paint technology" comprised of microscopic ceramic particles that make it extremely durable and remarkably protective of the color coat beneath. This is particularly beneficial in protecting against swirl marks, minor scratches and even many chemical contaminants. However, there still exist numerous natural and man-made challenges to your paint's gloss. Some examples are; highly acidic bird droppings, industrial fallout such as acid rain and metallic dust from train wheels or factories. Car wax and even many modern aftermarket paint sealants provide some protection, but can be extremely short-lived. Carnauba wax, a vegetable product found in high-quality car waxes, can lose its effectiveness within 6-8 weeks. Genuine Mercedes-Benz "Nano Paint Sealer Set" can last up to a year and is specifically designed for use on high-tech surfaces such as Mercedes-Benz SRC. It contains no wax or silicone; instead it "links" with the nano-particles to provide a simple and effective long-term seal without etching or abrading the paint finish.

It is normal for a properly functioning tire to lose air pressure over time - there are a couple of reasons for this: 1) air can diffuse through a tire at a rate of 1-2 psi per month; 2) a tire typically loses 1-2 psi of pressure for every 10-degree (Fahrenheit) drop in ambient temperature. When your tires are warm, whether from driving or being in an enclosed garage, their pressure will be significantly higher than after the vehicle has been parked outside on a cold winter day. This change alone could trigger your Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning light.The recommended inflation pressure listed in your vehicle's Operator's Manual or on the label inside the fuel door is a "cold" pressure, meaning the car has been parked outside in ambient temperature conditions for at least an hour and driven less than one mile since being parked. Mercedes-Benz recommends you check tire pressures with a high-quality gauge (accurate to 1 psi) at least once per month and not to wait for the TPMS indicator to illuminate.

From the brake calipers at each wheel, to under hood components such as the master cylinder and pump for Antilock Brake System (ABS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESP), the brake system contains complex parts that rely on brake fluid to perform their hydraulic tasks. Brake fluid is highly hygroscopic which means it tends to absorb moisture with age. This moisture consequentially creates corrosion within internal brake components and decreases the boiling point of the brake fluid, reducing braking effectiveness.The recommended interval for replacing brake fluid is every 2 years or 20,000 miles, whichever comes first. The procedure used to replace brake fluid must be performed using approved pressure bleeding machines and "DOT 4 plus" brake fluid. The machines that are used by Mercedes-Benz technicians are designed to operate at pressures which ensure proper evacuation of the fluid and won't damage any of the precision braking components. These machines also ensure that new brake fluid entering the brake system is free of moisture.If non-approved fluids are used or if the brake fluid becomes contaminated with mineral oil, then severe damage to brake components or brake failure can occur. It is essential that only qualified technicians using Mercedes-Benz approved equipment, parts and fluids perform maintenance or repairs on Mercedes-Benz vehicles.</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacellone">14</td><td class = "datacellone">      Link ::  Fail   Expected ::   OK        Actual  ::   NULL   </td><td class = "datacellfail">FAIL</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/heritage/events_community/overview</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mercedesbenz.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/heritage/events_community/overview</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/service_and_parts/overview</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.freightliner.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mbusa.com/vcm/MB/DigitalAssets/pdfmb/serviceandparts/guidelines_first_responders.pdf</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mbusa.com/vcm/MB/DigitalAssets/pdfmb/serviceandparts/seatbelts_airbags.pdf</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.smartusa.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mercedesroadside.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.homelink.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.startekinfo.com/StarTek/home.jsp</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/service_and_parts/warranty</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.mercedes-benz-mobile.com/us/en/intro_select.php</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.wireless4mb.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">14</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Link Text is Present  ::  'Expected Link Text' --> http://www.wireless4mb.com/</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">Scenario 7</td><td class = "datacelltwo">Golf</td><td class = "datacellGeneralUpdate">GeneralUpdate</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">7</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Learn more about > Events & Partnerships</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">7</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Mercedes-Benz & Golf</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">7</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Everything that makes golf more than a game is why we love it, too.</td><td class = "datacellpass">PASS</td></tr><tr><td class = "datacelltwo">7</td><td class = "datacelltwo">       As Expected -- Text is Present  ::  'Expected Text' --> Passion, precision and persistence.
