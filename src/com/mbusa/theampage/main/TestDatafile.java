DIP Switch Programmable2. Rolling CodeWhich Type Do You Have?Determine which type of garage door opener you have by opening the battery compartment on one of the handheld transmitters you use to operate your garage door.1. If you see a row of tiny sliding levers inside your handheld transmitter, your opener uses a single code to operate every time and is a"+" "+"\""+"DIP Switch"+"\""+" "+"programmable type transmitter. There is a lack of security when using these old technology transmitters because someone either could choose the same code as your opener, or a thief using a code grabber (a radio receiver which steals your code) could then open your door.2. If there are no switches, the opener is a Rolling Code type transmitter. This type of transmitter enhances security by using a new code each time the transmitter is operated, since codes which where previously used to operate the door are no longer recognized as valid. Use of this Rolling Codes started in 1996, and by 2000 most manufacturers had switched to this technology.Programming Homelink ButtonWarning! Before starting to program, ensure no one is standing under or near the garage door, as it may operate while programming the mirror!Using the instructions in your vehicle's Operator's Manual, you must program a button in the vehicle by holding a working handheld transmitter near the garage-door buttons while pressing the button in the vehicle. These buttons are located either in your vehicle's inside rearview mirror or overhead console (see your Operator's Manual for complete details). It is recommended that you put new batteries in the handheld transmitter before attempting to program your vehicle, so the transmitter is able to transmit at the proper frequency or proper code.For transmitters that control multiple garage doors and have multiple buttons, treat each button on the remote as if it was a separate transmitter.Verification That The Homelink Button Was ProgrammedVerification of whether the button in the vehicle is programmed is accomplished by pressing it. It should flash rapidly and then turn solid after 2 seconds.Programming Homelink to the Opener1. For DIP Switch Programmable transmitters no other action is necessary. The door should operate from either the mirror or the hand held transmitter.2. For Rolling Code Transmitters it may be necessary to program the Homelink button into your opener before it will operate the door.Then, using the instructions which came with your garage door opener, program the Homelink button into the garage door opener. Most opener's receivers will operate as follows. (Some may require a different procedure.) Locate its"+" "+"\""+"training,"+"\""+" "+"\""+"learn"+"\""+" "+"or"+" "+"\""+"smart"+"\""+" "+"button, and press it. Within 30 seconds, return to your vehicle and press the desired Homelink button in your vehicle for 2 seconds, then release it for 2 seconds, and then repeat this up to three times, until the button is trained and your garage door operates.Mercedes-Benz recommends that the handheld Rolling Code transmitter should be saved for when a new vehicle is purchased and needs to be programmed, and not used at the same time as the one in your mirror. This is because the button in the mirror has cloned the button from the original handheld remote, and is using the rolling code taken from it. This may in some cases cause the transmitter in the mirror to stop operating the opener, as the handheld or another vehicle transmitter may have already used the rolling code in your vehicle. Most openers can learn and simultaneously be linked to five or more remotes.";

This is to promote water drainage. If the steering wheel is released or the driver does not steer the vehicle on its intended path, it may drift or 'pull' to one side. Just as it is natural for a car to roll down a hill, there is an equally natural tendency for a car to drift toward the side on a laterally sloped roadway. While curved roads are often 'banked' toward the inside of a curve to promote safer cornering, straight roadways that slant to one side can require some force on the steering wheel - in the opposite direction - to maintain a straight-ahead path.

public static String FAQ_SubHeading_12_2_1_Data = "Why does the brake pedal in my hybrid Mercedes-Benz feel different the first time I step on the brakes after I start the vehicle and sometimes during normal driving?";
public static String FAQ_SubHeading_12_2_2_Data = "Hybrid vehicles utilize regenerative and conventional hydraulic braking to reduce the speed of the vehicle. For regenerative braking, the kinetic energy of the decelerating vehicle is absorbed by the electric motor to generate a brake torque. The generated electrical energy is then fed to the high voltage battery for storage. Conventional hydraulic brakes utilize hydraulic fluid to apply pressure to the brake pads which squeeze against a rotating brake rotor. Friction is created between the pads and rotor which generate a brake torque to stop the vehicle.Depending on the driving conditions, the total braking torque requested by the driver can be divided into a regenerative component and a hydraulic component. If the required total braking torque can be achieved using regenerative means alone, then none of the braking is done hydraulically. In this case deceleration is achieved solely by using the electric motors to generate electricity.Due to the operating principals involved, the perceived brake pedal feel may be different during regenerative braking compared to conventional braking. On the regenerative braking system, there is a length of free travel integrated into the connection of the brake pedal. This is used during the regenerative braking function. A pedal force simulator is used to create an artificial pedal resistance which mimics the brake pedal feel of conventional hydraulic brakes.During the first brake actuation, the system is checked for proper operation and the regenerative braking system is activated. The pedal force simulator is switched off for the first pedal application, resulting in slightly longer pedal travel compared to subsequent brake pedal applications when the system is active.If an ABS (Anti-Lock Brake System) intervention takes place, regenerative braking is terminated for this brake application and the braking torque is provided solely via the conventional hydraulic brakes.Regenerative braking is not possible below speeds of approximately 13 MPH. As soon as the vehicle drops below a speed of approximately 13 MPH during a brake application, the system switches from regenerative braking to hydraulic braking, resulting in a change of brake pedal feel and travel.";

It is normal for a properly functioning tire to lose air pressure over time - there are a couple of reasons for this: 1) air can diffuse through a tire at a rate of 1-2 psi per month; 2) a tire typically loses 1-2 psi of pressure for every 10-degree (Fahrenheit) drop in ambient temperature. When your tires are warm, whether from driving or being in an enclosed garage, their pressure will be significantly higher than after the vehicle has been parked outside on a cold winter day. This change alone could trigger your Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning light.The recommended inflation pressure listed in your vehicle's Operator's Manual or on the label inside the fuel door is a "+"\""+"cold"+"\""+" pressure, meaning the car has been parked outside in ambient temperature conditions for at least an hour and driven less than one mile since being parked. Mercedes-Benz recommends you check tire pressures with a high-quality gauge (accurate to 1 psi) at least once per month and not to wait for the TPMS indicator to illuminate.

From the brake calipers at each wheel, to under hood components such as the master cylinder and pump for Antilock Brake System (ABS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESP), the brake system contains complex parts that rely on brake fluid to perform their hydraulic tasks. Brake fluid is highly hygroscopic which means it tends to absorb moisture with age. This moisture consequentially creates corrosion within internal brake components and decreases the boiling point of the brake fluid, reducing braking effectiveness.The recommended interval for replacing brake fluid is every 2 years or 20,000 miles, whichever comes first. The procedure used to replace brake fluid must be performed using approved pressure bleeding machines and "+"\""+"DOT 4 plus"+"\""+" brake fluid. The machines that are used by Mercedes-Benz technicians are designed to operate at pressures which ensure proper evacuation of the fluid and won't damage any of the precision braking components. These machines also ensure that new brake fluid entering the brake system is free of moisture.If non-approved fluids are used or if the brake fluid becomes contaminated with mineral oil, then severe damage to brake components or brake failure can occur.

Acceleration shifts it rearward, while cornering transfers it toward the tires on the outside of a turn. In addition, the road conditions can affect how each wheel grips at any time. 4MATIC responds to all of these factors at once, optimizing the torque at each wheel to the conditions.",

That means the left and right wheels must be able to rotate at different speeds. 4MATIC continually monitors the speed of each wheel to know when it's turning at the proper speed, or not, in every situation.",
